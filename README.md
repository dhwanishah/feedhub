# feedhub android application

Created during the Hack Houston Hackathon this year (2015) and won the top six! 
A fun way to network and meet new people while getting free food! :D

- An app that lets you create your own profile and share meal points that you may have left over or just have too many that you will never use during your college semester.
- View other peoples posted meal points and ask to have breakfast/lunch/dinner with them. 
- Only students (valid .edu email) can post and/or request a free meal so safe
- [Still work in progress] Ability to chat with the other person before you go out to eat with them
